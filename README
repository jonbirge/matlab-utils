A set of small utilities to make programming in MATLAB, including GUI
development, more productive. These utilities aren't tied to a
specific field, and should be useful for most numerical work, I hope.

The addition of any similar tools developed by others would be a
welcome addition, as I'd like to see this become a large set of
general tools to be shared.
