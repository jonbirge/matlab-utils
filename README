A set of small utilities to make programming in MATLAB, including GUI
development, more productive. These utilities aren't tied to a
specific field of study, and are intended to be useful for general
numerical work.

The collection also includes a utility to assist with cleaning up a
SVN repository dump of all MEX binaries.

The addition of any similarly generally applicable tools developed by
others would be a welcome addition, as I'd like to see this become a
large set of general tools to be shared.
