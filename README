A set of small utilities to make programming in MATLAB, including GUI
development, more productive. These utilities aren't tied to a
specific field of study, and are intended to be useful for general
numerical work.

The highlights are: a rewrite of ls that shows the number of lines of
MATLAB code in each M file, with clickable links to open MATLAB-based
files; a utility to assist with cleaning up a SVN repository dump of
all MEX binaries; utilities to simplify GUI programming by allowing
easier access to handle properties.

The addition of any similarly generally applicable tools developed by
others would be a welcome addition, as I'd like to see this become a
large set of general tools to be shared.
