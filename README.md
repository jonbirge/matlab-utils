# MATLAB Utilities

## Overview

A set of small command utilities to make programming in MATLAB more productive. These utilities aren't tied to a specific field of study, and are intended to be useful for general work.

## Highlights

* A version of ls that shows the number of lines of code in each M file, with clickable links to open MATLAB-based files
* Simple MATLAB wrappers for git and svn, designed to allow some integration of version control from within the MATLAB command window.

## Notes

The addition of any similarly generally applicable tools developed by others would be a welcome addition, as I'd like to see this become a large set of general tools to be shared.
